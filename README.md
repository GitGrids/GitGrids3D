# Welcome to GitGrids3D! üéâ


Yo, what's good? You've just stumbled upon **GitGrids**, the wildest 3D audio-interactive particle visualizer this side of the multiverse! üöÄ Get ready to crank up the tunes, tweak some particles, and watch chaos unfold in glorious 3D. Whether you're vibing to a beat or geeking out over attractors, this app‚Äôs got you covered. So, buckle up and let‚Äôs make some visual magic!

## What‚Äôs GitGrids All About?

GitGrids is a web-based, audio-reactive 3D particle visualizer that lets you mess with particle systems, chaotic attractors, and trippy visuals, all synced to your favorite audio. Think of it as a playground for coders, artists, and anyone who loves shiny things. With a gazillion settings, you can customize particles, dynamics, visuals, camera paths, and even record your masterpiece in crispy 8K. ü§Ø

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get GitGrids up and running faster than a particle in a Lorenz Attractor:

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   Grab the code like it‚Äôs free candy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GitGrids.git
   ```

2. **Open the App**  
   No fancy setup needed! Just open `3D_audiointeractive_particlevisualizer_V0.2.22_latest.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge work best). It‚Äôs all client-side, so no server nonsense required.

3. **Play with the Controls**  
   The UI is your sandbox. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what you can do:
   - **Particle Settings**: Tweak the number, size, and shape of particles (from circles to Japanese katakana!).
   - **Dynamics**: Choose from mind-bending attractors like Lorenz, R√∂ssler, or even a Double Pendulum for that extra chaos.
   - **Visuals**: Play with opacity, color palettes (Fire, Ocean, Neon, oh my!), and add bloom or particle trails for extra pizzazz.
   - **Camera**: Set it to spiral, orbit, or go rogue with WASD controls.
   - **Audio**: Upload an audio file or record live to make particles dance to the beat. Adjust low/high-pass filters for that perfect vibe.
   - **Recording**: Capture your creation in WebM or MP4, from 720p to glorious 8K, with customizable bitrate and aspect ratio.

4. **Randomize & Record**  
   Feeling adventurous? Hit the **Randomize** button to let GitGrids surprise you. When you‚Äôre ready to immortalize your creation, click **Start Recording**, and save it in your preferred format.

## Pro Tips
- **Audio Reactivity**: Crank up the bass for wilder particle movements. The low-pass and high-pass filters help you focus the audio range.
- **Performance**: If your browser starts sweating with too many particles, lower the count or disable bloom/trails.
- **Recording**: Higher resolutions (like 8K) and bitrates (150 Mbps) will make bigger files, so make sure you‚Äôve got disk space!

## Troubleshooting
- **No visuals?** Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser.
- **Audio not reacting?** Check that your audio file is loaded or that your mic is working for live recording.
- **Recording won‚Äôt start?** Make sure you‚Äôve selected an export format and resolution.
